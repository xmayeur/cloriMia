FONTS:

To install the fonts, use the Font Control Panel.  Select "Install New Fonts"
from the File menu, then select the WYLD.TTF and WYLDI.TTF files.

WORD MACROS:

To use the Word macros, you must have Microsoft Word 95, 97, or 2000.  They
may work with other versions.  They have only been tested with Word 97.  To
install, copy the file WyldMacros.dot to the Word startup directory.  The
Word startup directory is located in different locations depending on the
version of Word and how Microsoft Office was installed.  The default
locations are:
  Word 95:   C:\MSOffice\Winword\Startup\
  Word 97:   C:\Program Files\MS Office\Office\Startup\
  Word 2000: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Startup\
The next time Word is started, there will be a small additional toolbar
containing two icons.  The ct icon with a ligature will add ligatures to all
text that is written in the Wyld font.  The ct icon without a liagture will
remove all ligatures from all text that is written in the Wyld font.  It may
be necessary to run this separately on the main text of the document and text
in headers, footers, footnotes, and other 'alternate' areas.
